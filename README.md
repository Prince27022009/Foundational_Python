# Foundational_Python
A hands-on Python learning repository demonstrating fundamental programming logic and project-based growth and learning.

## Projects

### Project 1: Arithmetic_Calculator
- **Description:** Calculates addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, Remainder and Square root. 
- **Skills Learned:** Conditional statements, Input handling, Error handling, Arithmatic operations, etc. 
- **How to Run:** [Instructions to run the project]  
- **Screenshot:** *(optional)*  

### Project 2: Snake_Water_Gun
- **Description:** A game similar to Rock_Paper_Sissor and based on simple concept of:
  üêç > üåä (Snake drinks water)
  üåä > üî´ (Water clogs the gun)
  üî´ > üêç (Gun shoots snake)
- **Skills Learned:** Conditional statements, Error handling, Input handling, problem solving, creative solution. 
- **How to Run:** ‚Ä¶  
- **Screenshot:** ‚Ä¶

### Project 3: BMI Calculator
- **Description:** Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) from user input and gives advice based on BMI values.  
- **Skills Learned:** Input handling, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, User Interaction, etc.
- **How to Run:**...

## Learning Journey
Through these projects, I practiced core Python concepts like loops, functions, conditionals, and techniques like File I/O, Error handling, and many more. Each project reflects my growth and understanding over time.

## Future Improvements
- Explore data structures and concepts like OOP, Decorators, Context managers and more in projects. 
- Add small automation scripts and beginner AI projects  
- Improve code readability, quality and modularity
- Explore on core concepts and topics of Computers, AI and Autonomous tech.
